# QuasarBrains - Infinitely extensible automation tools

Our goal is to build tools that developers can use to easily automate their lives and workflows. By building systems, both enterprise and open-source, that provide the heavy lifting, so that you can focus on the fun parts of the automation process.

## Projects
We have big plans! For now we're working on some smaller projects. 

### Assistant
